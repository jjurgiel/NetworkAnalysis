# NetworkAnalysis
This set of functions performed Network Contingency Analysis (NCA) on source-level EEG data, and is translated to work with EEG data from the fMRI implemented introduced in _Sripada, C., Kessler, D., Fang, Y., Welsh, R. C., Prem Kumar, K., & Angstadt, M. (2014). Disrupted network architecture of the resting brain in attention‚Äêdeficit/hyperactivity disorder. Human brain mapping, 35(9), 4693-4705._

The main goal of NCA is do determine whether a particular brain network, or pair of brain networks, are communicating aberrantly in a particular diagnostic group.

In brief:
* Effective (causal) connectivity is first calculated between pairs of dipoles using the groupSIFT toolbox (https://github.com/sccn/groupSIFT)
* ICA-localized dipoles are projected to a set of 286 parcels described in:
  * _Gordon, E. M., Laumann, T. O., Adeyemo, B., Huckins, J. F., Kelley, W. M., & Petersen, S. E. (2016). Generation and evaluation of a cortical area parcellation from resting-state correlations. Cerebral cortex, 26(1), 288-303._
* These parcels are segregated into 12 classical brain networks (as described in Gordon et al.), e.g. Default Mode, FrontoParietal, Visual, Ventral Attention, etc.
  * For example, the parcel mapping for the Default Mode network is shown below:

* Network-level statistics (using either t-test, ANOVA, regression model, etc.) are estimated on groupings of between-network and within-network connections, using a permutation-based approach to control for multiple comparisons within networks, in order to determine which networks show above-chance numbers of atypical connections
* False-discovery rate correction is additionally implemented to control for multiple comparisons across networks

Example outcome:

Here, a 2-group comparison analysis in network connectivity was performed. Red and blue dots indicate the direction of significant differences between groups for a particular connection (e.g., blue dots show that Group 1 > Group 2 for a connection, while red dots show Group 2 > Group 1).

Network cells (i.e., bigger squares) are shaded based on survival of permutation-based control, where color shading represents the percent of significant connections within that cell which are significant in a particular direction (i.e., if all dots are blue, meaning Group 1 > Group 2, then the cell will be shaded blue because Group 1 > Group 2 at the network level).
